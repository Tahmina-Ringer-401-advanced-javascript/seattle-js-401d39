# Facilitators Guide: Auth Module Final Project

## Overview

As this is the end of the Authentication/Authorization module, we will be focusing our attention today to a student-led, full review of the Server code.

Additionally, students will embark on a one day group project allowing them to explore the concepts learned to this point, without the burden of a strict requirement set.

### How does this topic fit?

**Where we've been**:
Throughout this module, we've been building a fully tested and documented authentication server, featuring middleware that can handle basic auth, bearer auth, and OAuth, as well as a Mongoose Schema for managing the user data.

**What are we focusing on today**:
Today, we'll be having the students work on polishing up the work on this server, and integrating it with the API server, written in the previous module. At the end, they'll have an authenticated API server that supports the creation of users, login, logout, and access controls.

**Where we're headed**:
Future modules will have the students exploring Real Time (sockets) & Event Driven Applications, and GraphQL. All of these modules will ultimately be able to work with each other as modules

## Learning Objectives

Review the detailed objectives in today's [student-facing readme](../README.md).

## Preparation

- Prepare a lecture on the Data Structure being introduced today

## Lecture Outline

Below is the expected lecture outline and flow. One possible way to present this material is documented in the [example lecture](./LECTURE-EXAMPLE.md) notes.

### Code Review

- Begin by getting a basic handle on what the students feel good about and where they want more information with regards to APIs and Authorization
  - It helps to take notes from them on a whiteboard
- Have one your students share their WRRC drawings with the class to explain the overall operation and data flows
- Have one your students share their UML drawings with the class to explain the application architecture
- Complete the previous lab (merging of the API and Auth) for them, as you would have done it
  - As you go, highlight those points that your class felt good about, and encourage them to help you code it out
  - Also as you go, when you hit parts that students struggled with, dive in and re-cover those topics as you build it out

### TOPIC 1: Module Recap

- **Why** (5 min)
  - Make sure the students are solid on all concepts learned to this point
- **What** (10 min)
  - Extensive code review with WRRC, UML Drawings, student led discussions and a full rebuild
  - Recap of testing methodologies
- **Experimentation and Discovery Ideas**
  - Go around the class asking for one thing they learned well enough to teach
  - Go around the class asking for one thing they don't understand and see if anyone can answer
    - After the first round, you may find there's nothing not covered
  - Have one person at a time add to a WRRC or Data Flow diagram on the board

## Lab Notes

Assign your students to groups of 2-4 to work on todays lab assignment

Today's lab will have the students in their own "sandbox" where they will be permitted to build anything they like, using the tools they've built so far.
