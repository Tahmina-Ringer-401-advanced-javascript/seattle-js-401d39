# Solution: Auth Module Final Project

## Lab Requirements

### How to grade this lab

This lab is largely going to be effort based. The students have relatively free reign on the problem domain and scope of their mini project.

What we're looking for in general:

1. Approach
   - Did they have a plan?
   - Did they draw UML or an interactivity diagram to inform the code/architecture?
1. Code Completion
   - Did they meet their goals?
   - Does the application/system work?
1. Code Quality
   - Is the architecture sound?
   - Is the code modularized?
   - Are there tests?
1. Features
   - Did they meet the core requirements?
     - Authentication
     - Access Control
